## Resources

As we move forward, you can find the sample code for the project on the  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sam-cogan/lambda-toys-api-infrastructure/). The main branch contains the code at the completion of the project, but each weeks content can be found on a separate branch so you can follow along as we build it.
