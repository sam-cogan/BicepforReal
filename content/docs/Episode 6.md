**Additional Information**

In this episode, we look at running a container with a docker image that has been imported from Docker hub to the Azure Container Registry in our subscription. However, I don't show how to do this import. If you would like to follow along and import this image, you can view the details in the video below.

## Resources

As we move forward, you can find the sample code for the project on the  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sam-cogan/lambda-toys-api-infrastructure/). The main branch contains the code at the completion of the project, but each weeks content can be found on a separate branch so you can follow along as we build it.
