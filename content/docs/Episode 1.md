Welcome to a brand new series where we take a deeper dive into using Bicep for Infrastructure as Code, and we do it with a real-world type project to work through. No more contrived examples or simple storage account; we will build what our project needs and hopefully pick up a few extra skills along the way.

In episode 1 we introduce the scenario we are going to be working through in the rest of this series and the requirements we need to fulful as we build out our infrastructure as code.
