Welcome to a brand new series where we take a deeper dive into using Bicep for Infrastructure as Code, and we do it with a real-world type project to work through. No more contrived examples or simple storage account; we will build what our project needs and hopefully pick up a few extra skills along the way.

In episode 1 we introduce the scenario we will be working through in the rest of this series and the requirements we need to fulful as we build out our infrastructure as code.

{{< notice note >}}
You may find that the ```Bicep --version``` command does not work and you need to instead use ```Bicep Version``` command. This seems to vary depending on whether you install bicep via the Azure CLI or standalone.
